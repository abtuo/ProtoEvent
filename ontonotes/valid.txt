We O
're O
talking O
about O
possibilities O
of O
full O
scale O
war B-Conflict:Attack
with O
former B-Personnel:End-Position
Congressman O
Tom O
Andrews O

He O

now O
national O

and O
former B-Personnel:End-Position
Congressman O
Bob O
Dornan O
, O
Republican O
of O
California O
. O
 
Bob O
, O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
think O
so O
many O
Americans O
are O
worried O
about O
this O
war B-Conflict:Attack
and O
so O
many O
people O
around O
the O
world O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
is O
there O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
problems O
with O
credibility O
from O
this O
administration O
. O
 
Our O
president O
has O
repeatedly O
, O
for O
example O
, O
relied O
on O
a O
man O
whom O
you O
're O
aware O
, O
Hussein O
Kamel O
, O
Saddam O
Hussein O
's O
son-in-law O
, O
leader O
of O
the O
Iraq O
arms O
program O
who O
defected B-Personnel:End-Position
for O
a O
time O
. O
 
And O
gave O
us O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
information O
and O
then O
went B-Movement:Transport
home O
and O
his O
father-in-law O
killed B-Life:Die
him O
. O
 
Bad O
move O
. O
 
But O
while O
he O
was O
here O
, O
he O
gave O
us O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
information O
. O
 
Gave O
us O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
information O
. O
 
Well O
, O
our O
president O
told O
us O
that O
information O
proves O
that O
the O
dictator O
had O
chemical O
weapons O
, O
which O
is O
true O
. O
 
But O
what O
we O
just O
learned O
this O
week O
from O
`` O
Newsweek O
'' O
magazine O
which O
got O
a O
hold O
of O
the O
debriefings O
, O
is O
that O
he O
also O
told O
us O
it O
was O
destroyed O
back O
in O
1995 O
. O
 
Why O
has O
n't O
our O
president O
told O
us O
that O
? O
 
Why O
do O
we O
have O
to O
learn O
it O
from O
`` O
Newsweek O
'' O
? O
 
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
he O
believed O
it O
was O
all O
destroyed O
. O
 
The O
fact O
that O
this O
guy O
was O
such O
an O
idiot O
to O
go B-Movement:Transport
back O
and O
let O
his O
father-in-law O
kill B-Life:Die
him O
shows O
he O
was O
n't O
the O
most O
stable O
of O
people O
. O
 
But O
the O
things O
that O
... O
 
Good O
point O
. O
 
But O
should O
n't O
our O
president O
have O
told O
us O
what O
the O
CIA O
told O
him O
. O
 
Why O
do O
we O
learn O
from O
`` O
Newsweek O
? O
 
`` O
Should O
he O
level O
with O
us O
? O
 
Paul O
, O
look O
, O
the O
problem O
is O
I O
would O
stipulate O
all O
four O
of O
us O
hates O
war B-Conflict:Attack
. O
 
Any O
rational O
person O
hates O
war B-Conflict:Attack
. O
 
Bush O
is O
n't O
sitting O
in O
that O
White O
House O
not O
thinking O
about O
the O
body O
bags O
coming O
home O
with O
great O
young O
men O
. O
 
Clinton O
suffered O
greatly O
over O
the O
19 O
Rangers O
that O
died B-Life:Die
, O
18 O
on O
the O
3rd O
of O
October O
and O
Matt O
Reersen O
( O

) O
three O
days O
later O
. O
 
I O
visited B-Contact:Meet
all O
their O
families O
. O
 
I O
was O
at O
the O
medal O
of O
honor O
ceremony O
for O
the O
kids O
. O
 
Let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
what O
trips B-Movement:Transport
to O
Walter O
Reed O
taught O
me O
was O
, O
that O
whoever O
thought O
up O
the O
term O
, O
the O
law O
of O
unintended O
consequences O
it O
pertains O
to O
war B-Conflict:Attack
. O
 
I O
am O
shook O
over O
the O
aftermath O
. O
 
But O
, O
this O
guy O
is O
a O
monster O
, O
a O
mini-me O
Hitler O
. O
 
He O
will O
blow B-Conflict:Attack
a O
city O
off O
the O
earth O
in O
a O
minute O
if O
he O
can O
get O
the O
hold O
of O
the O
means O
to O
do O
it O
. O
 
Tom O
Andrews O
, O
I O
think O
we O
all O
realize O
that O
a O
government O
does O
n't O
go O
to O
war B-Conflict:Attack
a O
nation O
goes O
to O
war B-Conflict:Attack
. O
 
And O
so O
I O
would O
like O
you O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
CNN/ O
'' O
USA O
TODAY O
'' O
/Gallup O
poll O
, O
taken O
last O
week O
, O
should O
U.S. O
troops O
to O
go B-Movement:Transport
to O
Iraq O
to O
remove O
Saddam O
Hussein O
from O
power O
. O
 
Take O
a O
look O
at O
it O
. O
 
Favor O
59 O
% O
, O
opposed O
37 O
% O
, O
that O
's O
a O
vastly O
larger O
support O
than O
President O
Bush O
Senior O
had O
in O
getting B-Movement:Transport
the O
U.S. O
troops O
out O
of O
Kuwait O
before O
that O
war B-Conflict:Attack
started O
. O
 
That O
's O
pretty O
good O
support O
is O
n't O
it O
? O
 
Now O
, O
Bob O
, O
come O
on O
you O
do O
n't O
really O
buy O
this O
. O
 
I O
mean O
, O
listen O
, O
this O
is O
the O
oldest O
trick O
in O
the O
book O
. O
 
You O
can O
have O
a O
general O
question O
like O
this O
that O
could O
mean O
anything O
and O
ask O
people O
and O
they O
give O
you O
what O
comes O
off O
the O
top O
of O
their O
head O
. O
 
But O
, O
ask O
them O
another O
question O
, O
ask O
them O
what O
they O
think O
about O
spending O
$ O
1.3 O
trillion O
in O
destroying O
this O
economy O
. O
 
Ask O
them O
about O
going O
and O
not O
just O
a O
war B-Conflict:Attack
, O
Bob O
, O
but O
an O
invasion B-Conflict:Attack
and O
occupying O
for O
up O
to O
10 O
years O
a O
sovereign O
Arab O
nation O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
one O
of O
the O
most O
distable O
and O
volatile O
regions O
in O
the O
world O
. O
 
Ask O
them O
how O
they O
feel O
about O
getting O
bogged O
down O
. O
 
Well O
, O
I O
've O
seen O
some O
of O
the O
figures O
. O
 
Once O
you O
start O
telling O
Americans O
the O
story O
, O
-- O
the O
administration O
refuse O
today O
tell O
us O
story O
. O
 
They O
're O
not O
coming O
forward O
and O
telling O
us O
what O
the O
risks O
are O
, O
what O
the O
costs O
are O
, O
how O
many O
years O
we O
might O
be O
in O
, O
the O
possibility O
of O
us O
getting O
bogged O
down O
, O
because O
what O
Americans O
know O
that O
, O
they O
're O
opposed O
to O
this O
war B-Conflict:Attack
. O
 
The O
more O
they O
learn O
about O
this O
invasion B-Conflict:Attack
, O
the O
more O
they O
learn O
about O
this O
occupation O
, O
the O
less O
they O
support O
it O
. O
 
Tom O
, O
you O
know O
what O
liberals O
want O
. O
 
They O
do O
n't O
want O
a O
smoking O
gun O
, O
they O
want O
a O
smoking O
city O
. O
 
The O
Clinton O
people O
all O
say O
... O
 
That O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
be O
last O
war B-Conflict:Attack
, O
unfair O
and O
unfortunate O
as O
that O
is O
, O
I O
am O
sorry O
, O
they O
're O
telling O
us O
we O
're O
out O

: O
Does O
your O

change O

No O

The O

something O

what O

What O
stops O
though O
- O
we O
know O
the O
Iraqis O
have O
fired B-Conflict:Attack
sand O
missiles O
and O
fired B-Conflict:Attack
AAA O
at O
aircraft O
all O
throughout O
this O
war B-Conflict:Attack
. O
 
They O
have O
n't O
hit B-Conflict:Attack
anybody O
, O
but O
is O
n't O
it O
risky O
flying O
so O
low O
knowing O
they O
have O
that O
ammunition O
to O
fire B-Conflict:Attack
at O
you O
. O
 
Again O
, O
we O
know O
where O
we O
're O
going O
. O
 
We O
know O
where O
they O
're O
at O
so O
we O
simply O
avoid O
them O
and O
if O
for O
some O
reason O
they O
do O
get O
off O
a O
lucky O
shot B-Conflict:Attack
or O
they O
do O
see O
us O
, O
we O
have O
defensive O
systems O
on O
board O
the O

to O
defeat B-Conflict:Attack
their O
ammunition O

We O
all O
fly O
with O
bulletproof O
vests O
in O
case O
the O
plane O
goes O
down O

We O
also O
fly O
with O
parachutes O
in O
case O
we O
need O
to O
get O
out O
before O
the O
plane O
goes O
down O

( O
voice-over O

: O
But O
three O
airmen O
aboard O

parachutes O
for O
a O
different O
reason O

They O
are O
the O

jumpers O
, O
or O
PJs O
who O
jump O
off O
the O

. O
 
I O
mean O
it O
's O
probably O
the O
most O
- O
the O
best O
feeling O
in O
the O
world O
knowing O
that O
your O
purpose O

really O
defined O

's O
plenty O
still O
out O
there O
that O
will O
have O
to O
be O
recovered O
because O
they O
can O
be O
used O

Do O
you O
know O
when O
this O

was O
last O
used O
? O
 
I O
mean O
do O
you O
know O
( O
UNINTELLIGIBLE O
) O
 
I O
'm O
not O
too O
sure O
but O
judging O
by O
some O
of O
this O
, O
it O
's O
been O
here O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
so O
whether O
it O
's O
been O
used O
recently O
by O
them O
- O
there O
was O
an O
Intel O
upbeat O
saying O
that O
they O
were O
possibly O
coming O
back O
to O
try O
and O
get O
this O
to O
use O
against O
them O

Grenades O

mortars O
, O
all O

abandoned O

but O
there O
for O

The O
job O
of O
these O
Royal O

is O
to O
clear O
this O
and O
many O
other O
mountains O
of O
armaments O
and O
destroy O
them O

Some O
are O
too O
unstable O
to O

to O
be O
blown O
up O
on O
the O

this O

becomes O
more O

important O

With O
the O

moving O

the O
last O
thing O
they O

is O
weaponry O

this O

With O
the O
amounts O
of O
ammunition O
and O
weapons O
left O
about O
, O
if O
they O
'd O
used O
those O
systems O
, O
that O
amount O
of O

it O
would O
have O
given O
us O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
trouble O
trying O
to O
take O
the O

With O
much O
of O
this O
weaponry O
there O
is O
only O
one O
safe O
thing O
to O

No O

They O
are O
trying O
to O
identify O

, O
as O
well O
as O
Iraqi O

, O
the O

they O
call O
it O
here O
at O
the O
White O

, O
who O
will O
be O
part O
of O
a O

process O
to O
begin O
the O

-- O
they O
say O
it O
could O

of O

who O
should O
be O

Now O
, O
we O

one O
person O
who O
will O
be O
invited O
is O
planning O
process O
, O
those O
planning O
meetings B-Contact:Meet
, O
is O
Ahmed O

He O
is O
the O
leader O
of O
the O

He O
is O

will O
be O
involved O
in O
the O

and O
in O
those O
meetings B-Contact:Meet

But O
I O
also O
should O
report O
that O
there O
is O
a O
sense O
of O
annoyance O
here O
at O
the O
White O

, O
even O
among O
some O
of O
Mr. O

, O
that O
, O
since O
returning B-Movement:Transport

in O
recent O
days O
, O
he O
has O
complained O
frequently O
, O
including O
on O

that O

today O
, O

again O
, O
a O

that O

Everyone O
has O
heard O
the O
story O
: O
Beatriz O
Marinello O
was O
elected B-Personnel:Elect
USCF O
President O
on O
August O
11 O
, O
2003 O
in O
Los O
Angeles O
. O
 
Immediately O
after O
she O
took B-Personnel:Start-Position
office O
, O
she O
found O
out O
that O
the O
USCF O
had O
no O
money O
in O
the O
bank O
, O
zero O
. O
 
The O
USCF O
did O
not O
even O
have O
the O
money O
to O
pay O
the O
guaranteed O
prizes O
at O
the O
just O
concluded O
US O
Open O
in O
Los O
Angeles O
. O
 
Therefore O
, O
on O
August O
20 O
, O
2003 O
, O
bravely O
Beatriz O
walked B-Movement:Transport
into O
the O
USCF O
Offices O
in O
New O
Windsor O
and O
immediately O
fired B-Personnel:End-Position
17 O
staff O
members O
. O
 
John O
McCrary O
resigned B-Personnel:End-Position
from O
the O
board O
as O
a O
result O
. O
 
Of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
just O
a O
pure O
coincidence O
that O
the O
17 O
people O
Beatriz O
fired B-Personnel:End-Position
were O
the O
people O
she O
had O
grown O
to O
dislike O
during O
the O
year O
that O
she O
worked O
for O
the O
USCF O
in O
1999-2000 O
. O
 
It O
took O
six O
weeks O
before O
the O
USCF O
paid B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
the O
guaranteed O
prizes O
the O
prize O
winners O
had O
won O
at O
the O
US O
Open O
. O
 
I O
have O
just O
found O
out O
something O
that O
insiders O
had O
known O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
 
The O
USCF O
did O
not O
have O
zero O
money O
in O
the O
bank O
. O
 
It O
had O
$ O
85,000 O
in O
another O
bank O
account O
that O
nobody O
knew O
about O
. O
 
This O
was O
not O
due O
to O
any O
malfeasance O
. O
 
The O
office O
accountant O
for O
the O
USCF O
had O
set O
up O
a O
separate O
bank O
account O
and O
had O
put O
the O
entry O
fees O
from O
the O
US O
Open O
into O
that O
account O
. O
 
Nobody O
knew O
about O
that O
separate O
bank O
account O
, O
except O
for O
the O
accountant O
herself O
. O
 
When O
this O
was O
discovered O
, O
the O
accountant O
explained O
that O
she O
was O
planning O
to O
keep O
the O
money O
in O
that O
account O
until O
the O
tournament O
was O
closed O
out O
. O
 
Perhaps O
the O
accountant O
was O
following O
a O
procedure O
followed O
by O
the O
USCF O
for O
scholastic O
tournaments O
. O
 
At O
scholastic O
tournaments O
, O
no O
cash O
prizes O
are O
paid B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
. O
 
However O
, O
in O
adult O
tournaments O
, O
the O
players O
expect O
to O
receive B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
their O
prizes O
, O
and O
to O
receive B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
them O
immediately O
. O
 
For O
this O
act O
of O
stupidity O
which O
had O
caused O
a O
grave O
crisis O
in O
the O
USCF O
, O
the O
accountant O
was O
immediately O
fired B-Personnel:End-Position
. O
 
Had O
the O
existence O
of O
this O
$ O
85,000 O
in O
a O
secret O
bank O
account O
been O
known O
, O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
necessary O
to O
fire B-Personnel:End-Position
those O
17 O
people O
right O
away O
. O
 
Perhaps O
in O
the O
long O
run O
it O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
to O
fire B-Personnel:End-Position
them O
, O
but O
it O
might O
not O
have O
been O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
fire B-Personnel:End-Position
them O
all O
abruptly O
, O
in O
the O
same O
day O

Sam O
Sloan O
 
Bullcrap O

He O
was O
embarassed O
by O
how O

misled O
him O
into O
thinking O
there O
would O
be O
a O
surplus O
. O
 
He O
was O
asked O
to O
wait O
until O
after O
the O
LA O
meeting O
was O
over O
before O
resigning B-Personnel:End-Position
. O
 
Right O
, O
we O
shoulda O
pissed O
another O
85,000 O
away O
before O
we O
stopped O
the O
red O
ink O
. O

Yes O
, O
Sam O
, O
you O
are O
correct O
. O
 
And O
I O
knew O
about O
it O
also O
. O
 
I O
also O
knew O
about O
the O
$ O
100,000+ O
of O
audit O
adjustments O
( O
and O
non-adjustments O
) O
for O

. O
 
that O
I O
was O
too O
sick O
to O
argue O
with O
Linda O
and O
the O
auditors O
about O
. O
 
I O
knew O
that O
they O
would O
get O
corrected O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
during O
fiscal O
2004 O
resulting O
in O
understatement O
of O
2003 O
income O
and O
overstatement O
of O
2004 O
. O
 
And O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
is O
what O
happened O
. O
 
I O
just O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
the O
new O
Board O
would O
see O
it O
as O
leverage O
to O
seize O
power O
and O
pummel O
the O
office O
staff O
. O
 
Not O
only O
was O
there O
adequate O
cash O
put O
aside O
, O
we O
had O
approval O
for O
an O
equity O
loan O
on O
the O
building O
to O
bridge O
the O
move O
. O
 
But O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
pay O
the O
$ O
10,000 O
points O
and O
interest O
unless O
and O
until O
it O
was O
absolutely O
necessary O
. O
 
We O
also O
had O
a O
buyer O
for O
the O
building O
at O
a O
prize O
much O
higher O
than O
it O
was O
eventually O
sold B-Transaction:Transfer-Ownership
for O
and O
a O
commitment O
for O
4 O
% O
bank O
financing O
in O
Crossville O
. O
 
Staff O
reductions B-Personnel:End-Position
were O
clearly O
in O
the O
works O
pending O
system O
changes O
that O
would O
be O
facilitated O
by O
any O
move O
, O
Miami O
, O
PBG O
, O
Crossville O
or O
elsewhere O
. O
 
To O
make O
the O
staff O
cuts B-Personnel:End-Position
without O
the O
system O
changes O
was O
absurd O
and O
probably O
the O
reason O
for O
McCrary O
& O
Camaratta O
's O
departures B-Personnel:End-Position
. O
 
When O
I O
offered O
to O
attend O
the O
Board O
meeting B-Contact:Meet
in O
October O
2003 O
to O
explain O
and O
clarify O
all O
this O
, O
I O
was O
told O
I O
was O
not O
welcome O
. O
 
I O
sat O
in O
New O
Windsor O
all O
weekend O
waiting O
for O
a O
phone O
call O
so O
I O
could O
answer O
EB O
questions O
and O
shed O
light O
on O
the O
situation O
. O
 
It O
is O
no O
coincidence O
that O
the O
employees O
let B-Personnel:End-Position
go I-Personnel:End-Position
included O
substantially O
all O
those O
who O
had O
offered O
to O
transfer B-Movement:Transport
to O
Crossville O
, O
including O
( O
remarkably O
) O
the O

You O

at O

some O

the O
time O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
this O
is O
so O
, O
and O
I O
really O
think O
it O
's O
sort O
of O
irrelevant O
. O
 
It O
's O
irrelevant O
because O
the O
REAL O
question O
is O
whether O
an O
active O
board O
member O
can O
, O
while O
on O
the O
board O
, O
arrange O
to O
be O
given B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
money O
by O
the O
USCF O
. O
 
Of O
course O
it O
's O
in O
the O
bylaws O
that O
an O
active O
board O
member O
can O
not O
be O
given B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
money O
by O
the O
USCF O
while O
on O
the O
board O
. O
 
It O
ought O
to O
be B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
pretty O
obvious O
that O
it O
would O
be B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
entirely O
contrary O
to O
the O
spirit O
of O
this O
for O
an O
active O
board O
member O
to O
be B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
money O
after O
leaving B-Personnel:End-Position
the O
board O
. O
 
Suppose O
, O
for O
example O
, O
there O
were O
to O
be O
a O
proposal O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
each O
EB O
member O
would O
be O
given B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
$ O
10,000 O
upon O
the O
expiration B-Personnel:End-Position
of O
his/her O
term O
. O
 
Clearly O
this O
would O
be O
a O
transparent O
attempt O
to O
evade O
the O
bylaws O
and O
would O
fail O
. O
 
If O
the O
board O
can O
not O
vote O
to O
give B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
themselves O
present O
money O
, O
they O
can O
not O
vote O
to O
give B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
themselves O
future O
money O
either O
. O
 
Furthermore O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
whether O
this O
arrangement O
is O
embodied O
in O
an O
EB O
vote O
or O
not O
, O
or O
whether O
the O
discussion O
of O
the O
proposal O
takes O
place O
in O
a O
formal O
EB O
meeting B-Contact:Meet
or O
not O
. O
 
A O
board O
member O
, O
while O

the O

, O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
representing O
the O

of O
the O

, O
not O
feathering B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
his/her O
nest O
, O
in O
the O

or O
in O
the O
future O
. O
 
If O
a O
board O
member O
makes O
such O
arrangements B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
, O
it O
is O
clearly O
an O
ethics O
violation O
, O
clearly O
a O
violation O
of O
the O

, O
possibly O
endangers O

The O
purpose O

voters O
time O
to O
elect B-Personnel:Elect
a O
new O
EB O
that O
would O
consider O
the O
issues O
objectively O
. O
 
Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
someone O
could O
leave B-Personnel:End-Position
the O
board O
-without- O
ever O
having O
discussed O
being O
compensated B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
by O
the O
board O
in O
the O
future O
, O
and O
that O
then O
the O
remaining O
members O
could O
, O
for O
good O
reason O
, O
hire B-Personnel:Start-Position
that O
person O
. O
 
It O
would O
create O
questions O
among O
the O
suspicious O
- O
and O
avoiding O
this O
appearance O
of O
wrongdoing O
would O
be O
another O
good O
reason O
for O
a O
time O
limit O
- O
but O
it O
would O
n't O
automatically O
be O
an O
ethics O
or O
bylaws O
violation O
. O
 
But O
this O
is O
neither O
here O
nor O
there O
, O
because O
the O
fact O
that O
Randy O
Bauer O
is O
already O
talking O
about O
Beatriz O
Marinello O
as O
the O
USCF O
's O
new B-Personnel:Start-Position
`` O
move O
coordinator O
'' O
, O
whatever O
that O
involves O
, O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
means O
that O
she O
would O
be O
the O
de O
facto O
interim O
ED O
, O
means O
that O
at O
some O
level O
and O
in O
some O
form O
these O
discussions O
HAVE O
already O
taken O
place O
, O
while O
Marinello O
is O
serving O
as O
President O
. O
 
I O
mean O
, O
it O
's O
conceivable O
that O
the O
other O
six O
have O
all O
gotten O
together O
in O
Marinello O
's O
absence O
and O
drafted B-Personnel:Start-Position
her O
, O
but O
it O
also O
seems O
pretty O
clear O
that O
she O
has O
agreed O
to O
do O
it O
, O
and O
, O
if O
all O
the O
rumors O
are O
true O
and O
she O
steps B-Personnel:End-Position
down I-Personnel:End-Position
, O
it O
will O
be O
so O
that O
she O
can O
take O
on O
these O
new O
responsibilities O
. O
 
So O
the O
'time O
limit O
' O
issue O
does O
n't O
even O
come O
up O
. O
 
We O
pretty O
much O
know O
that O
Marinello O
, O
while O
on O
the O
board O
, O
has O
arranged O
to O
get B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
future O
money O
from O
the O
USCF O
. O
 
So O
we O
already O
have O
a O
problem O
. O
 
If O
this O
is O
NOT O
a O
problem O
, O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
explain O
to O
me O
why O
not O
. O
 
Now O
, O
Stan O
B. O
argues O
that O
Marinello O
's O
services O
are O
in O
fact O
indispensible O
as O
move O
coordinator O
, O
and O
that O
ethics O
standards O
are O
not O
a O
suicide O
pact O
, O
so O
that O
since O
we O
absolutely O
NEED O
her O
the O
EB O
has O
the O
right O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
retain O
her O
. O
 
I O
agree O
with O
the O
principle O
. O
 
But O
I O
think O
that O
to O
make O
this O
argument O
work O
the O
EB O
would O
have O
to O
produce O
some O
evidence O
that O
Marinello O
really O
IS O
indispensible O
for O
this O
task O
. O
 
This O
would O
have O
to O
include O
evidence O
that O
the O
EB O
had O
considered O
all O
the O
alternatives O
, O
including O
: O
 
- O
delegating O
the O
whole O
thing O
to O
the O
Interim O
ED O
, O
which O
would O
be O
the O
normal O
practice O
in O
normal O
organizations O
with O
an O
ED O
 
- O
asking O
the O
Interim O
ED O
to O
designate B-Personnel:Start-Position
someone O
from O
the O
New O
Windsor O
staff O
to O
act O
as O
move O
coordinator O
 
- O
asking O
the O
Interim O
ED O
to O
hire B-Personnel:Start-Position
some O
other O
consultant O
with O
experience O
in O
office O
relocation O
to O
manage O
the O
job O
( O
there O
are O
such O
people O
) O
 
- O
conducting O
some O
kind O
of O
actual O
search O
for O
candidates O
for O
the O
position O
during O
the O
last O
two O
months O
since O
the O
move O
was O
decided O
upon O
 
If O
they O
did O
consider O
alternatives O
, O
it O
would O
also O
have O
to O
include O
evidence O
that O
Marinello O
has O
much O
more O
experience O
at O
relocating O
offices O
than O
other O
people O
, O
or O
is O
willing O
to O
do O
the O
job O
cheaper O
( O
although O
this O
would O
n't O
constitute O
being O
`` O
indispensible O
'' O
in O
my O
view O
) O
. O
 
If O
, O
however O
, O
they O
just O
looked O
around O
the O
room O
and O
said O
`` O
who O
is O
going O
to O
manage O
this O
? O
'' O
 
and O
someone O
said O
, O
`` O
Beatriz O
, O
how O
about O
you O
? O
 
`` O
, O
this O
does O
not O
constitute O
proof O
that O
her O
services O
are O
indispensible O
, O
and O
thus O
it O
would O
n't O
interfere O
with O
my O
belief O
that O
there O
has O
been O
an O
ethics O
violation O
and O
a O
bylaws O
violation O
. O
 
One O
very O
bad O
argument O
that O
was O
made O
by O
Kevin O
Bachler O
, O
which O
to O
be O
fair O
was O
surrounded O
by O
arguably O
better O
ones O
, O
was O
that O
since O
this O
board O
was O
elected B-Personnel:Elect
, O
we O
should O
let O
them O
do O
as O
they O
please O
. O
 
Which O
is O
to O
say O
that O
there O
might O
as O
well O
not O
be O
bylaws O
, O
ethics O
standards O
, O
laws O
, O
etc. O
, O
since O
an O
elected B-Personnel:Elect
board O
is O
not O
bound O
by O
any O
of O
them O
. O
 
I O
think O
this O
idea O
should O
be O
rejected O
. O
 
Another O
argument O
, O
which O
is O
better O
but O
still O
disturbing O
, O
is O
that O
, O
yes O
, O
this O
is O
an O
ethics O
violation O
, O
and O
maybe O
worse O
, O
but O
it O
would O
only O
hurt O
the O
USCF O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
and O
that O
only O
troublemakers O
like O
Sam O
Sloan O
, O
Larry O
Parr O
, O
and O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
me O
, O
would O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
since O
doing O
so O
will O
obstruct O
the O
federation O
's O
plans O
, O
cause O
us O
to O
pay O
legal O
expenses O
, O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
our O
being O
stuck O
without O
any O
office O
space O
at O
all O
, O
cause O
people O
not O
to O
loan B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
us O
money O
, O
and O
so O
forth O
. O
 
So O
we O
should O
all O
ignore O
this O
because O
it O
is O
realistic O
to O
do O
so O
. O
 
I O
'm O
not O
entirely O
unsympathetic O
to O
this O
, O
actually O
. O
 
But O
frankly O
I O
think O
that O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
the O
problems O
the O
USCF O
has O
had O
over O
the O
years O
have O
had O
to O
do O
with O
well-intentioned O
people O
keeping O
secrets O
because O
bringing O
them O
out O
in O
the O
open O
would O
harm O
the O
USCF O
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
we O
have O
awful O
habits O
which O
hurt O
the O
USCF O
even O
worse O
. O
 
But O
if O
we O
are O
going O
to O
talk O
about O
realism O
, O
here O
is O
another O
realistic O
concern O
: O
I O
predict O
that O
, O
if O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
rumors O
about O
the O
agenda O
for O
the O
Florida O
meeting B-Contact:Meet
prove O
true O
, O
and O
Marinello O
resigns B-Personnel:End-Position
as O
President O
and O
is O
hired B-Personnel:Start-Position
as O
move O
coordinator O
, O
the O
immediate O
result O
of O
this O
is O
that O
Sam O
Sloan O
will O
file O
another O
lawsuit B-Justice:Sue
( O
or O
amend O
his O
current O
complaint B-Justice:Sue
) O
charging B-Justice:Charge-Indict
the O
USCF O
EB O
members O
with O
self-dealing O
, O
violation O
of O
the O
USCF O
's O
own O
bylaws O
, O
and O
every O
other O
thing O
, O
report O
us O
to O
the O
IRS O
, O
and O
demand O
that O
all O
USCF O
moneys O
which O
might O
be O
used O
to O
paid B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
Marinello O
be O
frozen O
. O
 
This O
is O
not O
based O
on O
any O
communication O
from O
Sam O
, O
direct O
or O
indirect O
. O
 
It O
is O
just O
logical O
. O
 
If O
he O
is O
willing O
to O
file O
a O
lawsuit B-Justice:Sue
on O
the O
basis O
of O
New O
York O
non-profit O
organization O
law O
, O
which O
might O
or O
might O
not O
be O
applicable O
to O
the O
USCF O
, O
why O
would O
n't O
he O
file O
a O
lawsuit B-Justice:Sue
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
USCF O
's O
violation O
of O
its O
own O

, O
which O
unquestionably O
ARE O
applicable O
to O
the O

I O
wrote O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
quoting O
my O
own O
employer O

said O
that O

do O
what O
they O
want O
UNLESS O
they O
violate O
their O

. O
 
It O
is O
irritating O
enough O
to O
get O
sued B-Justice:Sue
by O
Sam O

imagine O
how O
irritating O
it O
would O
be O
to O
get O
sued B-Justice:Sue
by O
Sam O

Board O

Compensation O
 
Hello O
all O
, O
 
What O
is O
the O
recommended O
policy O
on O
compensating B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
board O
members O
for O
attending O
meetings B-Contact:Meet
, O
when O
they O
have O
no O
vacation O
time O
left O
at O
work O
, O
and O
are O
attending O
the O
board O
meeting B-Contact:Meet
on O
their O
own O
time O
, O
without O
pay B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
. O
 
We O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
lose O
the O
contributions O
of O
this O
board O
member O
, O
but O
this O
has O
become O
a O
financial O
issue O
. O
 
Thanks O
. O
 
If O
your O
organization O
is O
a O
charity O
, O
it O
is O
generally O
considered O
to O
be O
inappropriate O
, O
and O
in O
some O
jurisdictions O
, O
it O
is O
illegal O
to O
compensate B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
board O
members O
for O
their O
service O
. O
 
You O
should O
check O
out O
the O
law O
in O
your O
state O
and/or O
country O
. O
 
It O
is O
reasonable O
, O
however O
, O
to O
reimburse B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
board O
members O
for O
legitimate O
and O
necessary O
expenses O
incurred O
in O
order O
to O
serve O
on O
the O
board O
. O
 
I O
wonder O
if O
you O
could O
make O
a O
case O
for O
paying B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
someone O
to O
replace B-Personnel:End-Position
the O
board O
member O
so O
the O
board O
member O
can O
attend O
meetings B-Contact:Meet
. O
 
I O
'm O
not O
a O
lawyer O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
to O
be O
similar O
to O
reimbursing B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
a O
board O
member O
for O
a O
babysitter O
, O
which O
no O
one O
questions O
. O
 
Another O
possibility O
is O
to O
change O
the O
meeting B-Contact:Meet
times O
. O
 
Nathan O
 
We O
are O

, O
although O
we O
all O
live O
in O
different O

from O
coast O
to O
coast O
. O
 
It O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
find O
times O
for O
all O
of O
us O
to O
get O
together B-Contact:Meet
. O
 
Would O
I O
need O
to O
check O
the O
Maryland O
law O
or O
the O
law O
in O
the O
state O
in O
which O
this O
board O
member O
lives O
? O
 
Thanks O
. O
 
In O
IRS O
Publication O
557 O
, O
the O
sample O
draft O
articles O
of O
incorporation O
indicate O
that O
NO O
compensation B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
may O
be O
paid O
to O
directors O
. O
 
In O
fairness O
, O
reimbursement O
of O
out-of-pocket O
expenses O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
organization O
-- O
including O
travel O
and O
lodging O
to O
attend O
board O
meetings B-Contact:Meet
-- O
are O
allowed O
. O
 
However O
, O
Publication O
557 O
does O
not O
explicitly O
prohibit O
compensation B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
to O
directors O
. O
 
As O
far O
as O
state O
laws O
go O
, O
you O
must O
follow O
the O
laws O
for O
the O
states O
( O
1 O
) O
in O
which O
the O
organization O
is O
incorporated O
and O
( O
2 O
) O
in O
which O
the O
organization O
operates O
. O
 
For O
an O
organization O
that O
is O
incorporated O
in O
Maryland O
and O
has O
its O
headquarters O
in O
Maryland O
, O
the O
laws O
of O
Maryland O
apply O
without O
regard O
to O
the O
states O
in O
which O
the O
directors O
live O
. O
 
Remember O
, O
a O
corporation O
is O
legally O
a O
`` O
person O
'' O
, O
distinct O
from O
the O
corporeal O
persons O
who O
govern O
, O
manage O
, O
and O
operate O
the O
corporation O
. O
 
Thus O
, O
the O
laws O
applying O
to O
the O
corporate O
person O
are O
the O
laws O
of O
the O
state O
where O
that O
person O
`` O
lives O
'' O

the O

A O
European O

the O
issue O
of O
calling O

was O
discussed O
in O

on O
Wednesday O
at O
a O

The O
group O
could O
reach O
no O
consensus O
, O
the O
diplomat O
said O
. O
 
`` O
Nothing O
is O
going O
to O
change O
on O

`` O
That O

we O

get O
a O

I O
know O
the O
Americans O
are O
impatient O
, O
but O
the O
European O

has O
25 O

these O
things O
take O
time O
. O
'' O
 
Some O
of O
those O
interviewed O
tried O
to O
make O
it O
sound O
as O
if O
the O
reason O
they O
are O
hesitant O
to O
go O
along O
with O
Bush O
is O
because O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
Lebanon O
. O
 
But O
as O
The O
Captain O
points O
out O
, O
it O
probably O
has O
more O
to O
do O
with O
Iran O
: O
 
I O
suspect O
the O
true O
reason O
for O
the O
reluctance O
comes O
not O
from O
the O
`` O
delicate O
'' O
nature O
of O
Lebanese O
politics O
, O
but O
from O
the O
relationship O
between O
Hezbollah O
and O
the O
Iranians O
. O
 
The O
EU O
has O
tried O
for O
the O
past O
two O

to O
appease O
the O
Iranian O
mullahs O
into O
giving O
up O
their O
nuclear-weapons O
ambitions O

little O

They O
do O

want O
to O
rock O
the O

now O

attempting O
to O
starve O
out O
the O
mullahs O
' O
terror O
agent O
that O
conducts O
the O
proxy O
attacks B-Conflict:Attack
against O
Israel O
that O
Iran O
can O
not O
afford O
to O
do O
itself O
openly O
. O
 
They O
did O
not O
learn O
from O
Hitler O

Germany O
I O
guess O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
appease O
that O
guy O
too O

reminds O
me O
how O

how O
good O

'' O
 
Yup O
, O
you O
read O
that O
right O

Kofi O

performance O
is O
soooooo O
impressive O

Guess O
the O
democrats O
have O
their O
own O
Armstrong O
conspiracy O
to O
deal O
with O
. O
 
Why O
would O
an O
NBC O
reporter O

who O
also O
reports O

the O
U.N. O
for O
National O
Public O
Radio O
) O
take O
money B-Transaction:Transfer-Money
from O
the O
U.N. O
lobby O
? O
 
Perhaps O
because O
longtime O
NBC O
News O
anchor O
Tom O
Brokaw O
put O
his O
stamp O
of O
approval O
on O
the O
UNA-USA O

by O
acting O
as O
master O
of O

at O

Not O
surprisingly O
, O
Brokaw O

Another O

of O

from O

bureau O

at O

, O
a O
Ted O
Turner-funded O
online O
news O
service O
that O
covers O
the O
U.N. O
A O
fascinating O
part O
of O
the O
book O
is O
how O
Fasulo O
manages O
to O
gloss O
over O
Annan O
's O
role O
in O
the O
1994 O
genocide B-Conflict:Attack
in O
Rwanda O
. O
 
She O
tries O
to O
blame O
the O
U.S. O
and O
other O
members O
of O
the O
Security O
Council O
for O
not O
sending B-Movement:Transport
enough O
troops O
to O
stop O
it O
. O
 
She O
admits O
, O
however O
, O
that O
, O
`` O
The O
Rwanda O
massacres B-Conflict:Attack
occurred O
while O
Annan O
was O
U.N O
. O
 
Undersecretary O
General O
for O
peacekeeping O
, O
'' O
and O
that O
`` O
After O
he O
became O
SG O
[ O
Secretary O
General O
] O
, O
Annan O
commissioned O
a O
report O
to O
examine O
what O
had O
happened O
and O
suggest O
remedies O
. O
'' O
 
Later O
, O
`` O
Annan O
accepted O
responsibility O
for O
failing O
to O
act O
more O
quickly O
, O
'' O
she O
writes O
. O
 
But O
responsibility O
for O
what O
? O
 
The O
truth O
is O
that O
, O
as O
director O
of O
U.N. O
peacekeeping O
, O
Annan O
personally O
refused O
requests O
to O
authorize O
U.N. O
peacekeepers O
in O
Rwanda O
to O
seize O
weapons O
and O
prevent O
genocide B-Conflict:Attack
. O
 
Writer O
and O
author O
Philip O
Gourevitch O
has O
described O
in O
detail O
how O
, O
three O
months O
before O
the O
genocide B-Conflict:Attack
, O
Major O
General O
Romeo O
Dallaire O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
several O
thousand O
U.N. O
troops O
in O
Rwanda O
, O
sent O
a O
fax B-Contact:Phone-Write
to O
Kofi O
Annan O
's O
office O
, O
saying O
he O
had O
received O
evidence O
from O
a O
Rwandan O
government O
informant O
that O
genocide B-Conflict:Attack
was O
being O
planned O
. O
 
The O
informant O
offered O
to O
help O
U.N. O
forces O
in O
raiding O
the O
government O
stockpiles O
to O
be O
used O
in O
the O
genocide B-Conflict:Attack
campaign O
. O
 
All O
that O
the O
informant O
wanted O
in O
return O
was O
protection O
for O
himself O
and O
his O
family O
. O
 
But O
the O
general O
needed O
U.N. O
authorization O
to O
conduct O
such O
a O
raid O
and O
save O
lives O
. O
 
He O
asked O
for O
that O
approval O
but O
the O
answer O
came O
back O
in O
a O
now-infamous O
`` O
genocide O
fax B-Contact:Phone-Write
'' O
from O
Annan O
's O
office O
. O
 
It O
denied O
authorization O
for O
the O
mission O
and O
told O
him O
that O
he O
should O
turn O
the O
information O
provided O
by O
the O
confidential O
witness O
over O
to O
the O
Rwandan O
government O
which O
was O
planning O
the O
genocide B-Conflict:Attack
! O
 
The O
result O
was O
that O
the O
information O
dried O
up O
and O
the O
genocide B-Conflict:Attack
took O
place O
. O
 
Yup O
, O
good O
ole O
Kofi O
told O
this O
poor O
guy O
to O
give O
the O
secret O
info O
over O
to O
the O
very O
government O
that O
was O
planning O
the O
genocide B-Conflict:Attack
. O
 
What O
a O
great O
guy O
he O
is O
is O
n't O
he O
. O
 
Or O
how O
about O
the O
ongoing O
prostitution O
that O
's O
going O
on O
in O
the O

? O
 
Now O
the O
report O
comes O
out O

The O
article O
ends O
with O
the O
following O
: O
 
In O
an O
April O
30 O
, O
2001 O
, O
Washington O
Times O
column O
, O
Nat O
Hentoff O
noted O
that O
the O
media O
have O
devoted O
`` O
scant O
mention O
'' O
to O
the O
`` O
plain O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Annan O
, O
when O
he O
was O
head O
of O
the O
United O
Nation O
's O
peacekeeping O
office O
, O
who O
could O
have O
prevented O
the O
slaughter B-Conflict:Attack
of O
800,000 O
Tutsis O
and O
their O
sympathizers O
in O
Rwanda O
in O
1994 O
. O
'' O
 
It O
's O
true O
, O
Hentoff O
said O
, O
that O
the O
U.N. O
issued O
a O
report O
in O
1999 O
that O
acknowledged O
, O
to O
some O
extent O
, O
its O
role O
in O
the O
killings B-Conflict:Attack
. O
 
But O
for O
five O
and O
a O
half O
years O
, O
he O
noted O
, O
Annan O
`` O
refused O
to O
accept O
any O
responsibility O
for O
the O
Rwandan O
holocaust B-Conflict:Attack
until O
Mr. O
Gourevitch O
and O
others O
revealed O
that O
less O
than O
5,000 O
U.N. O
troops O
could O
have O
stopped O
the O
killings O
if O
Mr. O
Annan O
had O
not O
closed O
his O
eyes O
. O
'' O
 
It O
is O
astonishing O
that O
a O
journalist O
for O
NBC O
New O
would O
close O
her O
eyes O
to O
Annan O
's O
role O
. O
 
But O
that O
is O
what O
she O
was O
apparently O
paid O
to O
do O
. O
 
Got O
job O
? O
 
And O
so O
, O
I O
have O
rejoined O
the O
world O
of O
the O
fully O
employed O
. O
 
After O
Christmas O
, O
I O
got O
a O
call B-Contact:Phone-Write
from O
the O
wife O
of O
one O
of O
my O
former O
bosses O
( O
at O
my O
last O
full-time O
job O
) O
. O
 
She O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
Development O
Assistant O
at O
the O
retirement O
community O
where O
she O
works O
. O
 
I O
started B-Personnel:Start-Position
here O
4 O
weeks O
ago O
. O
 
WM O
is O
affiliated O
with O
, O
but O
not O
run O
or O
fully O
supported O
by O
, O
the O
denomination O
I O
've O
been O
a O
part O
of O
all O
my O
life O
( O
UMC O
) O
. O
 
My O
grandmother O
( O
who O
was O
Baptist O
) O
lived O
here O
for O
a O
few O
months O
before O
she O
died B-Life:Die
in O
1995 O
, O
so O
I O
have O
many O
connections O
to O
the O
job O
. O
 
Our O
offices O
are O
in O
one O
of O
the O
patio O
homes O
, O
and O
I O
have O
my O
own O
lovely O
office O
with O
a O
window O
. O
 
The O
job O
's O
only O
about O
12 O
miles O
from O
home O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
going O
against O
the O
bulk O
of O
the O
traffic O
mornings O
and O
afternoons O
. O
 
It O
all O
seems O
perfect O
and O
yet O
... O
Oh O
, O
I O
'm O
so O
thankful O
to O
be O
somewhere O
so O
nice O
where O
I O
might O
actually O
make O
a O
difference O
in O
people O
's O
lives O
, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
keep O
an O
open O
mind O
and O
hope O
it O
'll O
last O
forever O
, O
but O
I O
have O
a O
feeling O
I O
'll O
be O
restless O
within O
a O
year O
or O
so O
. O
 
My O
boss O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
person O
, O
but O
conservative O
and O
resistant O
to O
technology O
, O
i.e O
. O
 
computers O
, O
internet O
, O
etc O
. O
 
We O
just O
got O
new O
computers O
a O
week O
and O
half O
ago O
, O
and O
she O
's O
griping O
about O
XP O
( O
her O
old O
OS O
was O
Windows O
98 O
-- O
mine O
was O
95 O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
thrilled O
with O
the O
new O
stuff O
) O
. O
 
I O
tell O
her O
it O
'll O
just O
take O
some O
getting O
used O
to O
. O
 
We O
'll O
see O
. O
 
I O
'm O
not O
making O
the O
kind O
of O
salary O
I O
was O
hoping O
to O
get O
, O
but O
it O
's O
the O
best O
salary O
I O
've O
gotten O
thus O
far O
. O
 
When O
I O
was O
fulltime O
in O
radio O
I O
made O
a O
little O
less O
, O
but O
I O
got O
quite O
a O
few O
remotes O
, O
which O
make O
up O
for O
not O
getting O
a O
topnotch O
salary O
. O
 
I O
'm O
still O
doing O
my O
TV O
announcing O
and O
my O
weekend O
radio O
stuff O
, O
so O
that O
money O
will O
help O
. O
 
I O
'm O
going O
to O
start O
actively O
pursuing O
more O
voice O
work O
in O
the O
next O
month O
or O
so O
, O
too O
. O
 
My O
plan O
is O
to O
pay B-Transaction:Transfer-Ownership
off O
my O
car O
early O
, O
and O
then O
work O
on O
the O
other O
debts O
. O
 
I O
think O
it O
's O
time O
to O
go O
on O
and O
fill O
out O
the O
adoption O
applications O
. O
 
I O
'm O
terrified O
of O
more O
debt O
, O
but O
Mom O
and O
Dad O
will O
help O
with O
the O
money O
. O
 
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
they O
realize O
how O
expensive O
it O
all O
is O
. O
 
I O
'm O
thinking O
we O
might O
lean O
toward O
adopting O
from O
Guatemala O
, O
but O
we O
've O
still O
not O
hashed O
it O
all O
out O
. O
 
It O
's O
almost O
bad O
making O
some O
money O
now O
, O
because O
while O
most O
of O
me O
wants O
to O
save O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
the O
other O
, O
smaller O
part O
is O
screaming O
loudly O
for O
stuff O
, O
stuff O
, O
stuff O
! O
! O
! O
 
I O
've O
got O
a O
trial O
subscription O
to O
XM O
at O
work O
because O
of O
the O
Dell O
computers O
, O
and O
now O
I O
'm O
lusting O
to O
have O
it O
all O
of O
the O
time O
. O
 
G O
got O
me O
a O
nice O
office O
stereo O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
it O
does O
have O
an O
aux O
jack O
, O
so O
I O
could O
listen O
to O
it O
here O
. O
 
He O
asked O
if O
I O
wanted O
a O
car O
stereo O
, O
and O
I O
said O
no O
, O
but O
I O
do O
. O
 
There O
are O

many O
things O
I O
want O

I O
want O
family O
more O
. O
 
I O
think O
part O
of O
the O
draw O
of O
the O
other O
stuff O
is O
I O
could O
get O
it O
now O
. O
 
But O
I O
'd O
be O
paying O
for O
it O
later O

they O

note O
that O

one O
of O

i O

really O
a O

i O

that O

that O
is O
too O
much O

who O

seems O

the O

they O

is O
gap O

what O

is O
increasing O

everyone O
agrees O
that O
